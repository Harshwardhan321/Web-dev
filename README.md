* **Contribute to open-source projects and collaborate with other developers.**

**Current progress:**

* **I'm comfortable with the basics of HTML, CSS**
* **I'm actively learning Javascript**
* **I'm exploring Node.js and Express for building backend APIs.**


**What you'll find here:**

* **My MERN Stack learning roadmap:** A structured plan outlining the technologies I'm focusing on and the resources I'm using.
* **Completed projects:** Fully functional web applications demonstrating my MERN skills.
* **Work-in-progress projects:** Early prototypes and experiments showcasing my current learning progress.
* **Learning resources:** Links to tutorials, articles, and other materials that I'm finding helpful.
